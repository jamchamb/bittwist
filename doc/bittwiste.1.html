NAME
       bittwiste -- pcap capture file editor

SYNOPSIS
       bittwiste [ -I input ] [ -O output ] [ -L layer ] [ -X payload ]
                 [ -C ] [ -M linktype ] [ -D offset ] [ -R range ]
                 [ -S timeframe ] [ -T header ]
                 [ header-specific-options ] [ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes the bittwiste program, the pcap(3) capture file
       editor. Bittwiste is designed to work only with  Ethernet  frame,  e.g.
       link  type  DLT_EN10MB  in  pcap(3),  with a maximum frame size of 1514
       bytes which is equivalent to a MTU of 1500 bytes, 14 bytes for Ethernet
       header.

       Bittwiste  can  currently  edit  Ethernet,  ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP
       headers. If run with the -X flag, you can append your own payload after
       any  of  these  headers;  specified using the -L and -T flag. Bittwiste
       will, if not run with the -C flag, recalculate the  checksums  for  IP,
       ICMP,  TCP,  and  UDP  packets, except for the last fragment of a frag-
       mented IP datagram; bittwiste does not currently support checksum  cor-
       rection  for the last fragment of a fragmented IP datagram. While pars-
       ing the packets in a trace file, bittwiste will  skip,  i.e.  write  to
       output  file  as  is, any truncated packet, for example, an ICMP packet
       with a captured length of 25 bytes (we need at least 28 bytes; 14 bytes
       for  Ethernet  header,  minimum 20 bytes for IP header, and 4 bytes for
       ICMP header) does not give enough information on its  ICMP  header  for
       bittwiste  to  read and modify it. In this case, you can utilize the -L
       and -T flag to copy the original packet up to its IP header and  append
       your  customized  ICMP header and data to the packet using the -X flag.
       When specifying payload that covers the ICMP, TCP or UDP header and its
       data, you can use zeros, e.g. 0000 for 2 bytes of zeros, for the header
       checksum which is then corrected automatically by bittwiste.

       In order to simplify the way options are specified, you can  only  edit
       packets  of  a  specific  type supplied to the -T flag per execution of
       bittwiste on a trace file. In addition, the -T flag  must  appear  last
       among  the general options which are the -I, -O, -L, -X, -C, -M, -D, -R
       and -S flag.

OPTIONS
       -I input
              Input pcap based trace file.

       -O output
              Output trace file.

       -L layer
              Copy up to the specified layer and discard the  remaining  data.
              Value for layer must be either 2, 3 or 4 where 2 for Ethernet, 3
              for ARP or IP, and 4 for ICMP, TCP or UDP.

       -X payload
              Append payload in hex digits to the end of each packet.
              Example: -X 0302aad1
              -X flag is ignored if -L and -T flag are not specified.

       -C     Specify this flag to disable checksum correction. Checksum  cor-
              rection  is applicable for non-fragmented IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP
              packets only.

       -M linktype
              Replace the linktype stored in the pcap file header.  Typically,
              value for linktype is 1 for Ethernet.
              Example: -M 12 (for raw IP), -M 51 (for PPPoE)

              For the complete list, see:
              http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html

       -D offset
              Delete the specified byte offset from each packet.
              First byte (starting from link layer header) starts from 1.
              -L, -X, -C and -T flag are ignored if -D flag is specified.
              Example: -D 15-40, -D 10 or -D 18-9999

       -R range
              Save only the specified range of packets.
              Example: -R 5-21 or -R 9

       -S timeframe
              Save  only the packets within the specified timeframe with up to
              one-second resolution using DD/MM/YYYY,HH:MM:SS  as  the  format
              for start and end time in timeframe.
              Example: -S 22/10/2006,21:47:35-24/10/2006,13:16:05
              -S flag is evaluated after -R flag.

       -T header
              Edit  only  the  specified  header. Possible keywords for header
              are, eth, arp, ip, icmp, tcp, or udp. -T flag must  appear  last
              among the general options.

       -h     Print version information and usage.

       header-specific-options
              Each  packet  that  matches  the type supplied to the -T flag is
              modified based on the options described below:

              Options for tcp (RFC 793):

              -s sport or op,np
                     Source port number in integer value between 0  to  65535.
                     If op and np are specified instead, all occurrences of op
                     in the source port field will be replaced with np.

              -d dport or op,np
                     Destination port number in integer  value  between  0  to
                     65535.  If  op  and  np are specified instead, all occur-
                     rences of op  in  the  destination  port  field  will  be
                     replaced with np.

              -q seq
                     Sequence number in integer value between 0 to 4294967295.
                     If SYN control bit is set, e.g. character s  is  supplied
                     to  the -f flag, seq represents the initial sequence num-
                     ber (ISN) and the first data byte is ISN + 1.

              -a ack
                     Acknowledgment number  in  integer  value  between  0  to
                     4294967295.  If  ACK control bit is set, e.g. character a
                     is supplied to the -f flag, ack represents the  value  of
                     the  next  sequence number that the receiver is expecting
                     to receive.

              -f flags
                     Control flags. Possible characters for flags are:

                     - : remove all flags
                     u : urgent pointer field is significant
                     a : acknowledgment field is significant
                     p : push function
                     r : resets the connection
                     s : synchronizes the sequence numbers
                     f : no more data from sender

                     Example: -f s
                     If any of the flags is specified, all original flags  are
                     removed automatically.

              -w win
                     Window  size  in integer value between 0 to 65535. If ACK
                     control bit is set, e.g. character a is supplied  to  the
                     -f  flag, win represents the number of data bytes, begin-
                     ning with the one indicated in the acknowledgment  number
                     field that the receiver is willing to accept.

              -u urg
                     Urgent  pointer  in  integer value between 0 to 65535. If
                     URG control bit is set, e.g. character u is  supplied  to
                     the  -f flag, urg represents a pointer that points to the
                     first data byte following the urgent data.

              Options for udp (RFC 768):

              -s sport or op,np
                     Source port number in integer value between 0  to  65535.
                     If op and np are specified instead, all occurrences of op
                     in the source port field will be replaced with np.

              -d dport or op,np
                     Destination port number in integer  value  between  0  to
                     65535.  If  op  and  np are specified instead, all occur-
                     rences of op  in  the  destination  port  field  will  be
                     replaced with np.
