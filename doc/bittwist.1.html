BITTWIST(1)                                                        BITTWIST(1)



NAME
       bittwist -- pcap based ethernet packet generator

SYNOPSIS
       bittwist [ -dvh ] [ -i interface ] [ -s length ] [ -l loop ]
                [ -c count ] [ -m speed ] [ -r rate ] [ -p sleep ]
                pcap-file(s)

DESCRIPTION
       This  document describes the bittwist program, the pcap(3) based Ether-
       net packet generator. Bittwist is designed to work  under  Ethernet  II
       (IEEE 802.3) network with a MTU of up to 1500 bytes on 10Mbps (10Base-T
       Ethernet) or 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) link speed. Packets are  generated
       from  saved  tcpdump(1)  capture file referred to as trace file in this
       document. Some familiarity with tcpdump(1) and its  basic  options  are
       assumed  in  this  document.  Since bittwist uses functions provided by
       pcap(3) library, e.g.  pcap_open_live()  and  pcap_inject(),  to  write
       packets  onto  the network, it may require that you have special privi-
       leges, e.g. read access to /dev/bpf* on BSD or root access on Linux, to
       generate packets or to enumerate network devices with, for example, the
       -d flag.

       Bittwist will, if not run with the -s flag, inject each  packet  up  to
       its actual length (on-wire) instead of its captured length. If the cap-
       tured length is less than the actual  length,  bittwist  will  pad  the
       packet  with zeros up to its actual length prior to injection. Bittwist
       will, if not run with the -m, -r, or -p flag,  inject  packets  from  a
       trace  file  based  on the captured intervals, in particular, the time-
       stamp difference between two adjacent packets,  except  for  the  first
       packet  in a trace file, which is always injected immediately. Bittwist
       is designed to not to interfere with the packet data; it merely read  a
       packet and inject it as is onto the network. If modification is desired
       prior to injection of a packet, you can use the  bittwiste(1)  program,
       which does just that.

OPTIONS
       -d     Print a list of network interfaces available.

       -v     Print timestamp for each packet.

       -vv    Print timestamp and hex data for each packet.

       -i interface
              Send pcap-file(s) out onto the network through interface.

       -s length
              Packet length to send. Set length to:

              0 to send the actual packet length. This is the default.
              -1 to send the captured length.

              or any other value from 14 to 1514.

       -l loop
              Send  pcap-file(s) out onto the network for loop times. Set loop
              to 0 to send pcap-file(s) until stopped. To stop, type  Control-
              C.

       -c count
              Send  up  to  count packets. Default is to send all packets from
              pcap-file(s).

       -m speed
              Set interval multiplier to speed. Set speed to 0 or less to send
              the next packet immediately. Minimum positive value for speed is
              0.000001.

       -r rate
              Limit the sending to rate Mbps. Value for rate must be between 1
              to  1000.  This  option  is  meant  to  limit the maximum packet
              throughput.  If you  want  to  send  packets  at  line  rate  of
              100Mbps, try -m 0 -r 100

       -p sleep
              Set  interval  to sleep (in seconds), ignoring the actual inter-
              val. Value for sleep must be between 1 to 2146.

       -h     Print version information and usage.

BUGS
       File your bug report and send to:

              Addy Yeow Chin Heng &lt;ayeowch@gmail.com&gt;

       Make sure you are using the latest  stable  version  before  submitting
       your bug report.

       If you run bittwist with -m flag set to 0 without limiting the through-
       put with -r flag, pcap_inject() may return an error with the  following
       error string:

              send: No buffer space available

       We  recommend that you specify the -r flag to limit the packet through-
       put, e.g. -m 0 -r 100 to inject packets at a maximum rate of 100Mbps.
